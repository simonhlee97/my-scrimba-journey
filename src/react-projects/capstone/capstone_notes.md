# Challenge (Video 5)

Add state to our context and pass it through the Provider

1. Add state to hold the array of all photos our app gets from the API
2. Pass the array of all photos through the value of the provider so it's available anywhere the app accesses the context

# Challenge (video 6)

Get the JSON data with the photos information from the API and save it to context state

# Challenge (video 7)

Using the data in context state, map over it in the Photos page and display the images.

1. As soon as the ContextProvider component renders, get the JSON data from this url:
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bobziroll/scrimba-react-bootcamp-images/master/images.json

2. Save the array of data that comes back to state.
